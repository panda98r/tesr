The Jagannath Rath Yatra is an annual Hindu festival celebrated in Puri, Odisha, where the deities Jagannath, his brother Balabhadra, and sister Subhadra are taken from the main temple in massive, newly-built wooden chariots to their aunt's temple, the Gundicha Temple. Translating to "Chariot Journey," this event symbolizes the deities' descent into the world to mingle with devotees, creating a spiritual connection and a unique opportunity for non-Hindus to witness the deities. The massive processions feature three distinct, elaborately decorated chariots, with the festival culminating in a return journey, or Bahuda Yatra, after the deities' stay at Gundicha Temple.  
Key Aspects of the Festival
Deities and Chariots: Lord Jagannath (an avatar of Lord Vishnu/Krishna), his elder brother Balabhadra, and his sister Subhadra are the central figures. They are transported in three unique, large wooden chariots, each named and adorned differently. 
The Journey: The deities travel from the main Jagannath Temple to the Gundicha Temple, located a few kilometers away. This annual journey allows them to leave the temple and be seen by the public, a rare occurrence. 
Significance: The Rath Yatra is a symbol of equality and integration, bringing together people of all backgrounds. It's believed that pulling the chariots brings blessings and purifies one of sins. 
Duration: The deities stay at the Gundicha Temple for several days before returning to the main temple in a procession called the Bahuda Yatra. 
Rituals: Before the festival, the deities undergo a ritual bathing ceremony called Snana Purnima. The Gajapati Maharaja (ruler) also performs the 'Chera Panhara' ceremony, symbolically sweeping the chariots as a gesture of service to the deities. 
Cultural Impact: The festival attracts millions of pilgrims and tourists worldwide, becoming a major cultural and spiritual event. It has also gained international recognition, partly through the efforts of organizations like ISKCON.
